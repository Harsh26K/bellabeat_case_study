# bellabeat_case_study
the analysis of fitness tracker data

the project went through following phases:

## 1. Ask
  objective of the project was to find :
  #### 1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
  #### 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  #### 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
  
  The primary stakeholders for the project are :
  1.  **Urška Sršen** : Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
  2.  **Sando Mur** : Mathematicican and Bellabeat's cofounder, key manager
  The secondary stakeholders for the project are :
  1. **Bellabeat marketing analytics team** : Team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
## 2. Prepare
  #### 1. Where was the data stored?
    The data was taken from an public website named Kaggle.com under the name FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.
  #### 2. How is the data organized? Is it long or wide format?
    The some databases were in long format where some were in wide format.
  #### 3. Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?
    * Reliable: The data is not realiable, as there is no mention of margin of error and sample size is
    small to find solid trends and assumptions.
    * Original: The data is not original, as it is a public dataset made available through Mobius.
    * Comprehensive: The data is not comprehensive, as it doesn't include info about gender, age, health status pf the customer.
    * Current: The data is not current, as it contains info from 2016.
    * Cited : We have no information about whether the source is creadible or not.
  As no paramteres were satisfied, the integrity of the data is questionable and it cannot be used to 
 find proper trends and make solid conclusions around it, But the findings can be used to provide directions to the work.
## 3. Process
  The data was processed using Google Sheets and Rstudio.
  The steps taken for the processing are listed into new sheet in the same file.
## 4. Analyze
  The analysis was done using R and the plots for respective findings were plotted for better 
  understanding of the stakeholders.
## 5. Share
  A powerpoint presentation (Case Study.pptx) is made to share the findings and conclusions with the stakeholders.
